# PiCoRama
A group of MicroPython scripts / classes that operate a diorama with various lights, servos (e.g. for a door) oled display etc.

PiCoRama is a complete set of MicroPython scripts that can handle a diorama - this diorama may contain various lights,
some of which may be turn ed on / off at certain times, may flicker or fade. Additionally motion detection with a PIR 
can be used to initialize tv shows on a oled display. These shows consist of small b/w image animations derived from gifs.

The code is supposed to run on a Raspberry Pi PiCo but should also work on an ESP32 although I did not test ist.
